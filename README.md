# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This analysis was done with the objective to found out the goal of a Kickstarter dataset, focusing on the theater subcategory to study the relationship between the outcomes by launch date and outcomes based on goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Possible challenges that could be encountered would be at the time of counting the outcomes based on goals according to each goal parameter, when selecting the sheet column possible errors that could happen are when trying to haste the work pace if you select wrong or if you don't pin the desired column in the formula, when extending the cell the information changes.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Analyzing this line char can be deduce that May was the month with most successful outcomes to theater since in May is presented a spike at the top which means that is the maximum value in this case, then we can see it going downward along the months that in this case the successful cases are decreasing. The plays that were canceled were few since the lines stays under as if it was a continuous line since it doesn't change with time. 

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Only the outcome 45000 to 49999 was not successfull at all and the number failed increases at this rate, as well, the percentage canceled present a 0% which can denote that there were no play canceled in any range.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations presented in this dataset can be that there was necessary a change in the time since it was unicode which was not readable by the lector & needed to be converted, also it was limited in the filtering since it show the average per year and not each year which is something that can be solved. 

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
More options to visualize this dataset can be box & whisker plot to have a different point of view regarding the infomation, this way the outliers can be the information that are rare in this case the percentaje succesful, failed or canceled that are unique according the goal established.
